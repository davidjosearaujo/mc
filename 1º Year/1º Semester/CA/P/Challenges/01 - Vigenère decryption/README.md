There are 6 texts encrypted with a Vigenère cipher.
3 of the texts were originally in English, the other 3 in Portuguese.
You do not know which is in which language.

All texts were equally processed before being encrypted: all spaces and punctuation was removed, all characters other than roman characters or characters with diacritics were transformed (e.g. á -> a, ç -> c, etc.). Thus, the data subject to encryption was a pure sequence of low case letters, from a to z.

The texts were encrypted with one out of 3 different keys, each with a different length.

The challenge is as follows:

- You have to successfully recover 4 texts.
- A successful recovery means the identification of the text (once decrypted, you can use Google to that purpose).
- You have to describe the discovery process and provide the tools used for the task.
- You cannot use tools created by others or significative code samples prepared for the exact same goal. Failure to fullfil this requirement will disqualify your work.
