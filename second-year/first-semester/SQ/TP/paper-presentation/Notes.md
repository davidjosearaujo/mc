# Problem
>[[2009 - Ali - Quantum Key Distribution Using Decoy State Protocol.pdf|Unfortunately, for real-life experimental set-ups, which mainly based on faint laser pulses, the occasional production of multi-photons and channel loss make it possible for sophisticated eavesdroppers to launch various subtle eavesdropping attacks including the Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attack]]
## What is multi-photons and channel loss?

## What is a Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attack?

# Approach
>[[2009 - Ali - Quantum Key Distribution Using Decoy State Protocol.pdf|Objective of this study was experimental implementation of weak decoy + vacuum states QKD for increasing the performance of QKD system]]
## What is "weak decoy"?

## Explain vacuum state
