<!--
Problem Statement:
    - Context and Background: Explain the basics of Quantum Key Distribution and its importance in secure communication.
    - Threats and Limitations: Go into details about PNS attacks and how traditional QKD is vulnerable to these.
    - Motivation for Decoy States: Why decoy states are a potential solution, setting up the transition to the approach.
-->


# Context and Background

Quantum  Key  Distribution  (QKD)  can help two remote parties to set up the secure key by **non-cloning  theorem**.

<!--
Proposed Approach:
    - Concept of Decoy States: Describe what decoy states are and how they differ from signal states.
    - Detection Mechanism: Explain how the protocol uses decoy states to identify and prevent eavesdropping attempts.
    - Mathematical/Algorithmic Framework: Briefly touch on the key mathematical or algorithmic techniques used in their protocol.
