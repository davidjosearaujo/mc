# Context and Background

<div class="columns">

<div>

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can help two remote parties to set up the secure key by **non-cloning theorem**.

In theory, this ensures that these **states cannot be perfectly copied**, providing a layer of security against eavesdroppers.

# Threats and Limitations

In a Photon-Number Splitting (PNS) attack, an eavesdropper (Eve) targets multi-photon pulses.

These can be split without disturbing the transmission, allowing Eve to intercept and retain one or more photons while letting the rest pass to Bob undetected.

# Motivation for Decoy States

Hwang specifically proposed to use a decoy pulses that are **intentionally designed to have an intensity similar to single-photon states** but with slight variability.

<!--
By doing so, the system can detect discrepancies in photon statistics that would indicate a Photon-Number Splitting (PNS) attack. This strategy helps differentiate genuine signal states from decoy states, ensuring that any eavesdropping attempts are revealed through inconsistencies in detection rates.
-->

The decoy states help detect and mitigate PNS attacks by **analyzing discrepancies in photon detection rates**, while the GLLP security proof **ensures that the overall system remains robust** against potential vulnerabilities in realistic settings.

This combination improves both the security level and the key generation rate of QKD systems.

Entanglement Distillation Approach: This is a method used to strengthen entangled quantum states shared between two parties. By processing noisy or partially entangled states, Alice and Bob can create a smaller set of high-fidelity entangled pairs, boosting the security and reliability of their key exchange.

GLLP: The GLLP framework extends QKD security analysis to practical systems that use weak coherent states instead of ideal single-photon sources. It accounts for the imperfections in real-world implementations and provides a security proof that considers multi-photon emissions and realistic device imperfections.

# Key Generation Rate in QKD

<div class="columns">

<div>

How efficiently does a QKD system produces secure keys?

Combining **signal states**, carrying most of the secret bits, with **weak and Vacuum states**, to detect eavesdropping, improves QKD's key generation rate while maintaining high security.
