Note1: 10% is for the presentation, English, completeness and consistency of the work.
Note2: You can add one or 2 more sections, if necessary.
Note3: Work as a group of 3 (eventually 4) and start the work in class – present the main idea before the end of the class for approval.

## Deadline
Class + 2 weeks

#2: Produce a report (<= 5 pages)
- Title: For now its not relevant
- Fill in the name and affiliation part (include all of the group)
- Abstract (20%)
- Introduction (30%)
- Secure Life Cycle Description (40%)

Note: You will use this same work for future assignments – do it well.

## Abstract (20%)
Write a first version of an abstract (max 200 words) where your state that you are reporting about a secure solution developed to solve Reliability, Robustness and Security issues and why that solution is important, relevant and different from the existing applications.

Note1: Reliability and Robustness are defined in the “Extra slides”.
Note2: For the part of “different from the existing applications” try to be imaginative.
Note3: Define a sample project, sample solution with your team

## Introduction (30%)
Write an introduction (About 1 page), where you present a problem (real or ficticious) related to Reliability, Robustness and Security, these are only examples:
- E.g. 1. A nuclear power plant control system that has shown to be unreliable and unsecure – rebooting randomly, erroneous outputs, freezing, external actors entering the facilities, etc.;
- E.g. 2. A web app that can be brought down with a DoS attack, or is vulnerable to cross site scripting, accepts invalid inputs and processes them, can return unreliable results when attacked...;
- E.g. 3. Supermarket unpaid products detection system that shuts down or doesn’t detect randomly stollen products;
- E.g. 4. A car braking system that has performance issues (e.g. takes 250 ms to react to a brake commands), stops braking at midnight, instead of braking slowly activated the full brake power when commanded, sometimes no brake is actuated, can be hacked from the wifi network, etc.

Present the problem (you can also refer to real similar cases) and the reason why it is important to be solved (security, commercial, life threats, publicity/image, etc.).

Present the foreseen solution by focusing on:
- Secure development
- Quality of the solution
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, Accountability, Authenticity or Compliance of the solution whenever applicable.

And that will be the rest of the report...

## Secure Life Cycle Description (40%)
Write down a short plan (About 2 pages) by picking up at least one process per phase (there are 6 main phases) and developing it (what is planned to be done in each phase: who from you is the responsible for each phase, what tasks are foreseen, what tools and technologies are needed, what training …).

### Phases:
Present it in structured text (subsections, bullet points, table or diagrams, or a combination of those). Don’t forget to use/refer to the phases of the SSDL:
- Education and awareness
- Project inception
- Analysis and requirements
- Architectural and detailed design
