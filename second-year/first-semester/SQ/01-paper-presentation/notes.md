# Summary

This paper discusses the **development of quantum computers and their potential role in supporting the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN)** concept. Here are the key points:

-   NTT is working on developing a **new computing infrastructure to support Digital Twin Computing (DTC)**, which **requires processing huge amounts of data at unprecedented speeds**.

-   Quantum computers are being explored as a potential solution due to their ability to solve complex problems faster than conventional computers.

-   Two main **types of quantum computers** are discussed:

    -   Quantum computers using qubits.
    -   Ising machines, which specialize in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

-   Current challenges in quantum computing include:

    -   **Limited number of qubits**
    -   **Error** generation **due to noise**
    -   Need for **error correction**

-   NTT is researching various aspects of quantum computing, including:

    -   Developing the LASOLVTM computing system (an Ising machine)
    -   Investigating optical quantum systems and superconducting systems
    -   Researching error correction and suppression methods.

-   The paper outlines three main challenges in creating system architectures for quantum computers:

    -   Difficulty in application development
    -   Limited applicability of quantum computers to certain problems
    -   Need for increased scalability

-   To address these challenges, NTT is working on:
    -   **Abstracting quantum hardware** components for easier application development
    -   **Developing distributed operating systems** to combine quantum and classical computers
    -   **Improving qubit scalability** and error correction through software solutions.

The paper emphasizes the importance of creating a system architecture that maximizes the capabilities of quantum computers while addressing current limitations and challenges.
