1. Without extracting the virtual machine assigned to your team, add it as an
evidence source to FTK Imager running on your computer

2. Create a .e01 forensic image from the virtual machine with FTK Imager
✓ make sure you have enough disk space for the acquisition
✓ split into 4 096 MB files to fit into FAT32 file systems if needed
✓ enable compression, it’s slower, but takes less space
✓ validate the forensic image

3. Sign your forensic imaging acquisition report
As you already know, calculating acquired image hashes using summary functions is always good forensic practice.
Don't forget that in addition to guaranteeing the integrity of the files, it is also convenient to guarantee their authenticity through a digital signature.
I suggest you use Gpg4win (Windows) or GnuPG (Linux). They are easy to install and use:

Windows:
https://gpg4win.org/ (already contains Kleopatra frontend)

Ubuntu:
https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html
Frontends:
sudo apt install gpa
sudo apt install kleopatra

Use hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com server to export your public keys.

Notes:
======

You need to install FTK Imager first. Then you extract the file "Micro XP.7z".

To convert the Micro XP.vdi into a .vmdk file (readable by FTK), use the following elevated command:
VBoxManage clonehd --format VMDK mydisk.vdi mydisk.vmdk

You can "Create a Disk Image" (FKT Menu Option) from the image "Micro XP.vmdk

You may find more help on "FTK Imager Overview.txt",  "FTKImager_UserGuide.pdf"
On digital signatures you may find help on "GPG Commands.txt" or inside respective frontend manuals.
